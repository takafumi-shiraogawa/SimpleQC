# SimpleQC
A simple code of electronic structure theories for developing new methodologies and educational purposes.

## Feature
This code can be applied to generic molecules and basis sets thanks to the Psi4's atomic orbital (AO) integral modules. In the current version, only Hartree-Fock theory for the spin singlet state can be performed. Ground-state total energy, electronic energy, nuclei-repulsion energy, molecular orbital (MO) energies and coefficients, analytical AO and MO integrals for Hartree-Fock theory, and one-particle reduced density matrix (in AO basis) can be directly available from the code.

## Requirements
Psi4: for AO integral, numerical quadrature, and processing exchange-correlation potential

Basis_Set_Exchange: for processing molecular parameters and basis sets
